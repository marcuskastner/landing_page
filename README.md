## General info
This site is my personal web portfolio. It uses Gatsby on the front end and Sanity on the backend. Furthermore, I wanted to create a fun and inviting UX with various animations spread throughout the page

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React
* Gatsby
* Sanity
* Bootstrap
* Framer-Motion

## What I Learned
For this project I wanted the user to be taken on a journey to learn about me by going on a "journey through space". To implement this UI/UX I used XD to design the visual elements and framer-motions animation library to animate them in fun and interesting ways.
