      "This site could be used as a general template for any ecommerce application. It uses Gatsby on the front end and Sanity on the back end to pull all the product information. Making it extremely easy for clients to add or edit items in their store. Furthermore, the site is fully integrated with stripe to securely handle payments. I think the biggest accomplishment for myself with this project was that I had to go into Gatsby, Sanity and Stripe's documentation and solve my own problems because information and tutorials on the web for these tools is usually spares and or outdated. Also I designed this project from the ground up meaning I used XD to personally design the wireframes and user experience. Overally I am really happy with the project and I feel that it went a long way towards showing my proficiencies as a well rounded web developer.",

      "This is a react native marketplace app. I wanted to complete this project because I was interested in react native app developement. Furthermore, the app is integrated with Firebase Auth service to handle secure client login. Similarly to my other projects this required me to read through documentation and solve my own problems when they arise. I think this project shows I am interested in many different types of front end technologies and am constatly pushing myself to learn more.",
